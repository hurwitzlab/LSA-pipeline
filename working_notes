√change all instances of 'LSFScripts' to 'PBS_Scripts'

need to change something like this:
/gsfs1/rsgrps/bhurwitz/scottdaniel/uproc_shortread_to_pfam/data/split/DNA_4_GCCAAT_L002_R1_007.fa/00.fa

to this:
sample_id.fastq.xxx, where ”.xxx” is the chunk number (eg ‘.021’)

merge fastaToFastq.pl with fasta_to_fastq.pl (prefer the last name)

get help from that one script i co-wrote with bonnie in utils or uproc where i learned some basic input/output stuff
